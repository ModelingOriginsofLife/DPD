E5h4hDimersMic.dat - Demonstration of a reaction network involving aggregation of hydrophobic reactants by micelles.

ThreeTypeTrimers.dat - Another, more complex reaction network.

example.dat - Syntax for most of the parameters in a DPD control file.

simple_chem.dat - An example of the interaction between the type-changing chemistry and spatial aspects of DPD.  The forward reaction 1+2->1+3 is much faster than the back reaction, but physical aggregation of 2's leads them to dominate the population.

longtailbilayer.dat - Using DPD to form bilayers.
